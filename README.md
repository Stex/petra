Petra is a proof-of-concept for persisted transactions in Ruby.

It allows starting a transaction without committing it and resuming it at a later time, even in another process.

It works on every Ruby object and can be extended to work with web frameworks like Ruby-on-Rails as well (a POC of RoR integration can be found at [stex/petra-rails](https://github.com/stex/petra-rails)
