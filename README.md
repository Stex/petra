Petra is a proof-of-concept for persisted transactions in Ruby.

It allows starting a transaction without committing it and resuming it at a later time, even in another process.

It should work with every Ruby object and can be extended to work with web frameworks like Ruby-on-Rails as well (a POC of RoR integration can be found at [stex/petra-rails](https://github.com/stex/petra-rails). 

Please note that this was created during my master's thesis in 2016 and hasn't been extended a lot since then except for a few coding style fixes. I would write a lot of stuff differently today, but the main concept is still interesting enough.
